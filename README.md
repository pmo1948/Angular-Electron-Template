# GuiPoc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.8.

## Developing
To run the program in dev mode with electron, run `npm run start:electron`. This will run the program in hot-reload, so you can see your changes as you go.

## Release
For your first release, run `npm run release -- --first-release`. 

For second and later releases, run `npm run release` or `release:minor`, `release:patch`, or `release:major` to force a version type.

Running these scripts will auto-increment the version, add well as update the [changelog.md](./CHANGELOG.MD) with the proper changes.
